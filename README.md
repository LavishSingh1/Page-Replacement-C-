# Page-Replacement-C-
This GitHub repository contains implementations of four popular page replacement algorithms in C programming language: FIFO (First-In-First-Out), Optimal, MRU (Most Recently Used), and LRU (Least Recently Used). These algorithms are essential components of operating systems, managing the page table to handle page faults efficiently.

## Algorithms Included

1. **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**:
Replaces the oldest page in memory when a page fault occurs.
2. **Optimal**:
Selects the page that will not be used for the longest period in the future.
3. **MRU (Most Recently Used)**:
Replaces the page that has been most recently used when a page fault occurs.
4. **LRU (Least Recently Used)**:
Replaces the page that has not been used for the longest period of time.


## Usage

* Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
* Navigate to the Repository:
```bash
cd page-replacement-algorithms
```

## Notes

The programs include visualization options (commented out) to observe the state of frames after each page request.
You can modify and adapt the code as needed for your specific requirements.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements or additional page replacement algorithms to share, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
